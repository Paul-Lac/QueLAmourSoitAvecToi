# Que l'Amour soit avec toi

## Introduction

This project, "Que L'Amour Soit Avec Toi," was developed as part of a 48-hour hackathon organized during my training at the Wild Code School, where I am pursuing the title of a web developer. The hackathon's theme, "Star Love," challenged us to create technology that connects beings across galaxies and helps them find love.

## Overview

We decided to turn this theme into a game: choose your character and try to woo one of the three main characters from Star Wars. The project is a playful take on the idea of intergalactic connections and the quest for love.

## Technologies used

- React
- HTML
- CSS

## Accessing the game

The deployed version of the game is available at: https://paul-lac.github.io/QueLAmourSoitAvecToi/. Feel free to explore the game and enjoy the interactive experience.
